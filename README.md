I am a bachelor's degree student majoring in Biology with an emphasis in Tropical Biology at the [National University of Costa Rica](https://www.una.ac.cr/). I am interested in basically everything related to biology, but in recent years I have worked directly with bats and bat ecology. I have also done numerous laboratory assistantships and fieldwork in refuges such as the [Lapa Verde Wildlife Refuge](https://www.ecovida.ch/es/refugio-lapa-verde) in Sarapiquí, Heredia, Costa Rica. I have also worked in scientific illustration for communication and conservation purposes, and I have given talks to high school groups on several occasions.
